			<p class="animal-description">German Shepherds have a two-layer coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants;
				medium and long. Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black
				masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an over-all "blanket."
